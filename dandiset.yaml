description: The relationship between mesoscopic local field potentials (LFPs) and
  single-neuron firing in the multi-layered neocortex is poorly understood. Simultaneous
  recordings from all layers in the primary visual cortex (V1) of the behaving mouse
  revealed functionally defined layers in V1. The depth of maximum spike power and
  sink-source distributions of LFPs provided consistent laminar landmarks across animals.
  Coherence of gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) and spike-LFP coupling identified six
  physiological layers and further sublayers. Firing rates, burstiness, and other
  electrophysiological features of neurons displayed unique layer and brain state
  dependence. Spike transmission strength from layer 2/3 cells to layer 5 pyramidal
  cells and interneurons was stronger during waking compared with non-REM sleep but
  stronger during non-REM sleep among deep-layer excitatory neurons. A subset of deep-layer
  neurons was active exclusively in the DOWN state of non-REM sleep. These results
  bridge mesoscopic LFPs and single-neuron interactions with laminar structure in
  V1.
